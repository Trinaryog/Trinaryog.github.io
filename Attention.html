  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Do you know what your child is watching on YouTube?</strong></p>
  <p>Recently there has been a surge of videos on YouTube that we now refer to as "ElsaGate". These videos (you might've seen some on channels such as Big cartoon or BeepBeepTV) usually contain sexual and Violent content. We reccomend reporting these videos to YouTube if you see them. Many of your child's favorite characters are usually portrayed in these videos. Such as Spiderman, Elsa, Mickey Mouse, Peppa Pig, and others. Again, if you see these videos anywhere on YouTube (usually on YouTube Kids), report them immediately.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7h7jz8/masterpost_of_infographics_posters_and_flyers/">This</a> is a link to the master post of helpful posters and flyers that warn parents about this problem on YouTube. Spread the word about this problem and please, pass these posters in you community/neighborhood and start spreading awareness about this huge problem. Thank you.</p>
